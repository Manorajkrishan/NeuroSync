# NeuroSync Enhancement - Starting Implementation Plan

## Immediate Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive proposal, here's what we'll start building:

### Step 1: Create Core Architecture (Foundation)
1. Multi-layer emotion fusion service structure
2. Enhanced emotion models and data structures
3. Framework for integrating all 4 layers

### Step 2: Enhance Existing Layers
1. Improve visual layer (add micro-expressions support)
2. Enhance audio layer (add tone analysis)
3. Strengthen contextual layer (add activity tracking)

### Step 3: Build New Components
1. Biometric integration service (framework first)
2. Advanced fusion algorithm
3. Enhanced action orchestrator

### Step 4: Ethical Framework
1. Consent management system
2. Privacy controls
3. User preferences for emotion sensing

## Quick Wins (Can Implement First)

1. **Enhanced Audio Analysis** - Add tone stress detection to existing audio
2. **Activity Context** - Track user activity alongside emotions
3. **Multi-layer Emotion Model** - Data structure to hold all 4 layers
4. **Ethical Consent UI** - User consent for emotion sensing
5. **Advanced Action Mapping** - Better emotion-to-action rules
