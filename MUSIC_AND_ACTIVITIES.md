## How to See It

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5) to get the updated code
2. **Try detecting different emotions**
3. **See the music and activity suggestions** appear in the UI!

## Future Integration Ideas

To make this work with real music services:

1. **Spotify API**: Connect to Spotify to actually play music
2. **YouTube Music API**: Use YouTube Music playlists
3. **Apple Music API**: Integrate with Apple Music
4. **Custom Playlists**: Allow users to create their own playlists
5. **Smart Speakers**: Connect to Alexa, Google Home, etc.

## Current Implementation

Right now, this is **simulated** - it shows what music would play, but doesn't actually play it. This is perfect for:
- ✅ Demonstration
- ✅ Testing
- ✅ Proof of concept
- ✅ Future integration

**To actually play music**, you would need to integrate with a music service API (Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.) or connect to smart speakers.
